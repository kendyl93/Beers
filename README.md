# Run the app

In order to run the app follow these steps:

1. Make sure you are in a root folder and run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
2. Run the app typing `npm run start`. App should opem automatically in `localhost:8080`.
3. Enjoy ! 🍺

## Some notes

1. App is not fully covered by tests. There are some tests included to show my skills. I prepared the boilerplate from scratch and tests are automatically start on commit/push.
2. I used Redux to open/close the Modal. It is some kind of overkill but I wanted to show my skills.
